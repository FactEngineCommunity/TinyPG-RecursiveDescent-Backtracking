# TinyPG-with Recursive Descent and Backtracking

A fork of the TinyPG parser, modified to perform recursive descent and backtracking.

As part of our work at FactEngine we needed a parser with recursive descent and backtracking. We had already done quite a bit of work with TinyPG and are very taken by the technology. It's simple and effective.

This fork modifies TinyPG to provide ordered recursive descent and backtracking.
